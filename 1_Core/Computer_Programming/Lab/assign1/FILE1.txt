This is from the IEEE Spectrums third interactive ranking of the most popular programming languages.

As it is impossible to look over the shoulder of every programmer, Spectrum uses various metrics as proxies for gauging the current use of a language.


Working with data journalist Nick Diakopoulos, from 10 online sources we've chosen 12 metrics, each one of which gives insight along a different axis of popularity. Combining the metrics produces a single ranking.

So what are Spectrums Top Ten Languages for 2016?

R is following its momentum from previous years, as part of a positive trend in general for modern big-data languages that Diakopoulos analyses in more detail here.

After two years in second place, C has finally edged out Java for the top spot.

Staying in the top five, Python has swapped places with C++ to take the No. 3 position, and C# has fallen out of the top five to be replaced with R.

In the losing side, perhaps the most surprising is that Shell programming a catchall term for the creation of scripts of the sort beloved by system administrators, using shells such as bash has declined in popularity, falling seven positions to 19th place.
This may reflect the development of more sophisticated systems to manage cloud-based data centers, but we'll have to wait to see if the trend contin ues next year or if this is just a statistical fluke.
